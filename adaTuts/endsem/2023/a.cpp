// a) Prove that edit-distance between two strings A, B of size respectively m, n is always bounded
// by (m + n âˆ’ 2|LCS(A, B)|), where |LCS(A, B)| is the length of longest common subsequence of A and B (when these strings are viewed as sequences).
// (b) An edge (x, y) in an undirected graph G is said to be a bridge if each path from x to y in G
// passes through edge (x, y).
// Prove that an edge is a bridge if and only if it does not lie on any simple cycle of G.
// (c) Device an O(m+n) time algorithm that verifies whether a given directed graph with n vertices
// and m edges is strongly connected (i.e. has exactly one SCC) using only BFS traversal.(Also
// provide short correctness argument).
// (d) Device the most efficient algorithm to verify whether a given directed graph with n vertices
// and m edges has a unique topological ordering. (Also provide a very short correctness proof
// of your algorithm)


let x is prob in NP class,then wich is true-
a. theres no poly time algo for x
b. if x can be deterministically solved in poly time, then p=np
c. if x can is np hard, i is np complete
d. x undeicedble
