// 3. Suppose you are given an n × n square grid with some of the cells being marked.
// Your input is a 2D array Mn×n such that M(x, y) is TRUE if and only if the cell
// appearing at x-th row and y-th column is marked. A monotone path starts from

// the top-left cell, moves only right or down at each step, and ends at the bottom-
// right cell. The objective is to cover the marked cells with as few monotone paths as possible.

// (a) Describe an algorithm to find a monotone path that covers the largest number
// of marked cells.

// (b) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that computes the minimum num-
// ber of monotone paths that covers every marked cell.
