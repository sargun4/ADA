 ### 1. Algorithm to Compute the Reversal $rev(G)$ of a Directed Graph

To compute the reversal of a directed graph $G$ in $O(V + E)$ time, we simply need to reverse the direction of all edges in the graph. Here's the algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty graph $rev(G)$.
2. For each vertex $v$ in $G$:
   - For each outgoing edge $(v, u)$ in $G$, add an incoming edge $(u, v)$ to $rev(G)$.
3. Return $rev(G)$.

This algorithm traverses each edge once and adds its reverse to the new graph, resulting in a time complexity of $O(V+E)$.

### 2. Proving the Acyclicity of $scc(G)$

The strong component graph $scc(G)$ is a directed graph formed by contracting each strongly connected component of $G$ into a single vertex. This graph is acyclic because:

- By definition, every strongly connected component has at least one cycle within itself.
- When we contract each strongly connected component into a single vertex, all internal cycles disappear, leaving only the connections between the components.
- Therefore, $scc(G)$ cannot contain any cycles, making it acyclic.

### 3. Proving $scc(rev(G)) = rev(scc(G))$ for Every Directed Graph $G$

The strong component graph of the reversal of a directed graph is equal to the reversal of the strong component graph of the original graph. This can be proven as follows:

- Let $C$ be a strongly connected component in $G$. When we reverse $G$, the strongly connected component $C$ becomes a strongly connected component in $rev(G)$ as well.
- When we form the strong component graph of $G$, there is a directed edge from $S(u)$ to $S(v)$ if there exists a vertex $u$ in $S(u)$ and a vertex $v$ in $S(v)$ such that there is a path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$.
- Similarly, in $rev(G)$, there is a directed edge from $S(u)$ to $S(v)$ if there exists a vertex $u$ in $S(u)$ and a vertex $v$ in $S(v)$ such that there is a path from $v$ to $u$ in $rev(G)$, which is equivalent to a path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$.
- Therefore, the strong component graph of $rev(G)$ is equal to the reversal of the strong component graph of $G$, i.e., $scc(rev(G)) = rev(scc(G))$.

### 4. Proving $u$ Can Reach $v$ in $G$ if and Only if $S(u)$ Can Reach $S(v)$ in $scc(G)$

Let's prove this statement:

- If $u$ can reach $v$ in $G$, it means there is a path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$. Since each vertex in a strongly connected component can reach every other vertex in the same component, there must be a path from $S(u)$ to $S(v)$ in $scc(G)$.
- Conversely, if there is a path from $S(u)$ to $S(v)$ in $scc(G)$, it means there is a sequence of strongly connected components $S(u), S_1, S_2, ..., S(v)$ such that there are directed edges from $S(u)$ to $S_1$, $S_1$ to $S_2$, and so on until $S(v)$. Therefore, there is a path from a vertex in $S(u)$ to a vertex in $S(v)$ in $G$, which implies $u$ can reach $v$ in $G$.
