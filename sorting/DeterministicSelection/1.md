# Deterministic Selection

## Problem Definition
**Input:** An array A of n distinct numbers and an integer k ∈ {1,...,n}.  
**Goal:** Find the k’th smallest element of A.

## Some Possible Algorithms and Their Running Times

### 1. QuickSelect (Average Case)
- **Description:** QuickSelect is a randomized algorithm based on the QuickSort partitioning technique. It works by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array, and recursively searching in one of the partitions.
- **Running Time:** On average, QuickSelect has a linear expected running time of O(n), but in the worst case, it may take O(n^2) time. The worst-case scenario occurs when the selected pivot consistently leads to imbalanced partitions.

### 2. Deterministic Selection using Median of Medians
- **Description:** This algorithm aims to improve the worst-case performance of QuickSelect by using the Median of Medians technique for pivot selection. It ensures a more balanced partitioning, resulting in a worst-case time complexity of O(n).
- **Running Time:** O(n) in the worst case, making it a deterministic linear-time algorithm.

### 3. Heap-based Algorithm
- **Description:** You can maintain a min-heap of size k to find the k-th smallest element. Initially, insert the first k elements into the heap. For each subsequent element, compare it with the root of the heap. If it is smaller, remove the root and insert the new element.
- **Running Time:** O(n log k) - Since we are maintaining a heap of size k, each insertion and removal operation takes logarithmic time.

### 4. Sorting and Picking
- **Description:** Simply sorting the array and selecting the k-th element.
- **Running Time:** O(n log n) - Sorting the entire array takes O(n log n) time, but this approach is not optimal if k is significantly smaller than n.

### 5. Randomized Selection
- **Description:** Similar to QuickSelect, but instead of always selecting the first element as a pivot, a random element is chosen as the pivot to improve average-case performance.
- **Running Time:** O(n) on average, but with a small probability of O(n^2) in the worst case.

The choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the input data, the desired guarantees on running time, and whether a deterministic or randomized solution is preferred. Deterministic Selection using Median of Medians ensures a worst-case linear time, making it suitable for situations where worst-case performance is critical.
