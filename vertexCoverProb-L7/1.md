## Vertex-Cover Problem

### Definition:
A vertex cover of an undirected graph \(G = (V, E)\) is a subset \(V_0 \subseteq V\) such that for every edge \((u, v) \in E\), either \(u \in V_0\) or \(v \in V_0\) (or both). The size of a vertex cover is the number of vertices in the cover.

### Decision Problem:
The decision problem associated with the vertex-cover problem is denoted as VERTEX-COVER, defined as follows:
\[ \text{VERTEX-COVER} = \{ \langle G, k \rangle \mid \text{graph } G \text{ has a vertex cover of size } k \} \]

### Theorem 34.12:
**The vertex-cover problem is NP-complete.**

### Proof Overview:
1. **Show NP Membership:**
   - Given a graph \(G = (V, E)\) and an integer \(k\), the certificate is the vertex cover \(V_0 \subseteq V\) itself.
   - Verification checks that \(|V_0| = k\) and, for each edge \((u, v) \in E\), either \(u \in V_0\) or \(v \in V_0\).
   - Verification can be done in polynomial time.

2. **Show NP-Hardness:**
   - Reduce from the CLIQUE problem to VERTEX-COVER, showing CLIQUE \( \leq_p \) VERTEX-COVER.
   - The reduction relies on the complement of a graph, and it's shown that \(G\) contains a clique of size \(k\) if and only if \(G\) has a vertex cover of size \(|V| - k\).

### Conclusion:
The proof establishes that the vertex-cover problem is both in NP and NP-hard, implying that it is NP-complete. The result indicates the difficulty of finding an optimal solution for the vertex-cover problem, as NP-complete problems are not expected to have efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms unless P = NP.

### Additional Note:
- **Approximation Algorithm:** Section 35.1 is mentioned to present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the vertex-cover problem. This algorithm produces solutions that are at most twice the size of the minimum-size vertex cover, providing a near-optimal solution in polynomial time.
